The Rare Disease Common Data Model (RD CDM) is a non-balloted extension of the 
ERDRI-CDS which aims to provide as an internationally viable template for the 
development and implementation of country-specific Rare disease common data 
models. The RD CDM is designed to be compatible with the GA4GH Phenopacket 
Schema, HL7 FHIR, and the International Patient Summary. The ontology-based 
approach of the RD CDM allows for the integration of various data sources and 
the harmonization of data across different systems.

.. attention::
    The RD CDM paper is currently under review. As soon as it is published, we
    will provide a link to the paper here and all tables and figures will be
    available in the paper.
