## Project Description

The Rare Disease Common Data Model (RD CDM) is designed to harmonize rare 
disease data capture across international registries. It integrates standards 
such as the ERDRI-CDS, HL7 FHIR, and GA4GH Phenopacket Schema, creating a 
scalable, ontology-driven framework that supports advanced interoperability for 
research and care. The RD CDM Version 2.0 consists of 66 data elements, 
extending the ERDRI-CDS and allowing deeper insights into genetic findings, 
phenotypic features, and family history of individuals.



## Features

- Interoperability: Aligns with HL7 FHIR v4.0.1 and GA4GH Phenopacket v2.0 for
    structured data exchange.
- Ontology-driven: Utilizes ontologies such as SNOMED CT, LOINC, MONDO, OMIM, 
    and HPO for standardizing rare disease terminologies.
- Modular Structure: Comprises essential data elements categorized into formal 
    criteria, personal information, patient status, disease, genetic findings, 
    phenotypic findings, and family history.
- Cross-registry Compatibility: Enables data reuse across multiple registries 
    with consistent encoding and semantic alignment.
