## Project Description

The ontology-based rare disease common data model (RD-CDM) is designed to 
harmonize rare disease data capture across international registries. It 
integrates standards such as the ERDRI-CDS, HL7 FHIR, and GA4GH Phenopacket 
Schema, creating a scalable, ontology-driven framework that supports advanced 
interoperability for research and care. The RD CDM Version 2.0.0 consists of 
78 data elements, extending the ERDRI-CDS and allowing deeper insights into 
genetic findings, phenotypic features, and family history of individuals.

## Features

- Interoperability: Aligns with HL7 FHIR v4.0.1 and GA4GH Phenopacket v2.0 for
    structured data exchange.
- Ontology-driven: Utilizes ontologies such as SNOMED CT, LOINC, MONDO, OMIM, 
    and HPO for standardizing rare disease terminologies.
- Modular Structure: Comprises essential data elements categorized into formal 
    criteria, personal information, patient status, disease, genetic findings, 
    phenotypic findings, and family history.
- Cross-registry Compatibility: Enables data reuse across multiple registries 
    with consistent encoding and semantic alignment.

## Getting Started

This section provides instructions for getting started with the RD CDM. For more
detail please read our  [Documentation](https://rd-cdm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies in requirements.txt

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/BIH-CEI/rd-cdm.git
  cd rd-cdm
  ```

2. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. Run tests to validate the JSON schema:
  ```bash
  pytest tests/
  ```

## RareLink 

RareLink is a novel rare disease framework in REDCap linking international 
registries, FHIR, and Phenopackets based on the RD-CDM. It is designed to 
support the collection of harmonized data for rare disease research 
across any REDCap project worldwide and allows for the preconfigured export of 
the RD-CDM data in FHIR and Phenopackets formats.
