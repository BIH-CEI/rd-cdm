.. attention::
    The RD CDM paper is currently under review. As soon as it is published, we
    will provide a link to the paper here and all tables and figures will be
    available in the paper. The version 2.0.0.dev0 is the initial release of 
    the RD CDM under review.

The RD CDM is developed within an open-source community and is available for use
by researchers, clinicians, and other stakeholders in the rare disease community.
The RD CDM is designed to support the collection of harmonized data for rare
disease research and treatment, making interoperability a crucial enabler for
improving outcomes in RD care.
