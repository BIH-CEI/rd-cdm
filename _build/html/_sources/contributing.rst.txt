RD CDM Contributing
===================

As we are actively developing the RD CDM, we welcome contributions in the form 
of new resources, new concepts, or new relationships. This RD CDM is a
non-balloted extension of the ERDRI-CDS which aims to provide as an 
internationally viable template for the development of country-specific 
common data models. Furhtermore, the RD CDM is designed to be compatible with
the GA4GH Phenopacket Schema, HL7 FHIR, and the International Patient Summary.

We encourage contributions to the RD CDM. These contributions can be in the
form of new resources, new concepts, relationships, or implementations.

If you would like to contribute, please consider the following:
