The ontology-based rare disease common data model (RD-CDM) is a non-balloted extension of the 
ERDRI-CDS which aims to provide as an internationally viable template for the 
development and implementation of country-specific Rare disease common data 
models. The RD-CDM is designed to be compatible with the GA4GH Phenopacket 
Schema, HL7 FHIR, and the International Patient Summary. The ontology-based 
approach of the RD-CDM allows for the integration of various data sources and 
the harmonization of data across different systems.

.. tip::
    The RD-CDM paper has now been published at Nature Scientific Data. You can
