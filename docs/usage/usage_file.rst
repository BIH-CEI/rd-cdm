============

.. tip::
    The RD-CDM paper has now been published at Nature Scientific Data. You can 
    read it `here <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04558-z>`_!

The RD CDM is developed within an open-source community and is available for use
by researchers, clinicians, and other stakeholders in the rare disease community.
The RD CDM is designed to support the collection of harmonized data for rare
disease research and treatment, making interoperability a crucial enabler for
improving outcomes in RD care.

Please see the :ref:`license_file` for information on the RD CDM license.

.. note::
    The RD-CDM is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions from
    researchers, clinicians, and other stakeholders in the rare disease community.
    If you would like to contribute to the RD CDM, please read our :ref:`contributing`.


RareLink
--------

RareLink is a novel rare disease framework in REDCap linking international 
registries, FHIR, and Phenopackets based on the RD-CDM. It is designed to 
support the collection of harmonized data for rare disease research 
across any REDCap project worldwide and allows for the preconfigured export of 
the RD-CDM data in FHIR and Phenopackets formats.
